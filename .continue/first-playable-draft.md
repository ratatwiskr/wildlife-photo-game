## Objective

- Load scenes from `assets/scenes` on startup.
- Achieve a playable first draft where the game can load and render scenes correctly.
- Ensure coherence among project files.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Evaluation and Setup

#### Tasks

- [ ] Evaluate `index.html`, `main.ts`, and related TypeScript files for relevant areas.
- [ ] Read existing documentation related to scene loading and rendering.
- [ ] Check for existing tests covering scene loading and rendering components.
  - [ ] Identify test files that need updates or new tests required.
- [ ] Set up a local development environment for the feature.

### Milestone 2: Design and Architecture

#### Tasks

- [ ] Define the scope of the new feature (loading scenes from `assets/scenes`).
- [ ] Create wireframes or mockups if applicable, to visualize scene loading and rendering.
- [ ] Plan how to separate concerns effectively within the new feature.
  - [ ] Ensure that scene loading is modular and decoupled from rendering.
  - [ ] Define a clear interface for scene data.
- [ ] Decide on language-specific best practices that will be followed (TypeScript conventions, module structure).
- [ ] Outline initial API endpoints, functions, classes, and methods needed for scene loading and rendering.

### Milestone 3: Implementation (TDD Approach)

#### Tasks

1. **Red Phase: Write a Failing Test**

   - [ ] Identify the next smallest piece of functionality to implement.
     - Examples: Loading a scene from `assets/scenes`, parsing JSON data, initializing the renderer with scene data.
   - [ ] Write unit tests for each behavior.
     - Ensure they fail before implementation begins.

2. **Green Phase: Implement Minimal Solution**

   - [ ] Implement just enough code to make these tests pass.
     - Avoid over-engineering; focus on meeting the requirements of the failing test only.

3. **Refactor Phase: Refine Code if Needed**
   - [ ] Review and refactor your implementation to improve readability, maintainability, or performance while ensuring all tests still pass.
   - [ ] Repeat this Red-Green-Refactor cycle until a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is achieved.

### Milestone 4: Testing and Validation

#### Tasks

- [ ] Write additional unit tests covering any new code paths not already covered by TDD.
  - Test edge cases, such as loading a non-existent scene or malformed JSON data.
- [ ] Conduct integration testing with existing components to ensure scenes load correctly on startup.
- [ ] Validate the feature against initial requirements.

### Milestone 5: Review and Optimization

#### Tasks

- [ ] Perform a comprehensive code review for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- [ ] Refactor code if necessary to improve performance or design.
- [ ] Ensure all unit tests pass.

### Milestone 6: Documentation

#### Tasks

- [ ] Update user documentation during each increment.
- [ ] Update API documentation (if applicable) as the feature evolves.
- [ ] Add inline comments within code where necessary for clarity.

## Summary of Improvements Planned

- Ensure scenes are loaded from `assets/scenes` on startup.
- Implement a playable first draft with scene rendering.
- Refactor and optimize code for performance and maintainability.
