# current tasks

I updated the project from originally using animals as svgs on a background image to using a background jpg (including animals) in addition to a mask png with only animals in unique colors.

this is not yet fully working, we need to take a look at the current implementation and fix the wiring between classes and scene files.

proceed read-only first, get accustomed to the ts files

the game has never been working properly, it is in an early stage. regard the classes as drafts, that need refinement.

can you walk the code through for startup and check what needs to be fixed (check html too) to make the first scene load instantly. later we could add a scene selection menu
